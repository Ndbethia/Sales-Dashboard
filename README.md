To gain deeper insights and provide actionable recommendations, the following analyses are suggested:

• Order Analysis: Order quantity trends over time and Order volume by product line.
• Customer Analysis: Customer segmentation based on sales volume, Geographic distribution of customers (by city, state, country, territory), and Average sales per customer.
• Product Analysis: Best-selling and worst-selling products, Comparison of MSRP vs actual sales price, and Product performance by category (product line).
• Shipping and Order Status Analysis: Order status distribution (delivered, disputed, etc.), Trends in shipping times and delays, and Impact of order status on customer satisfaction and repeat business.

# Conclusion
The analysis of the Retail Sales dataset from Kaggle, focusing on vehicle sales from 2003 to 2005, has provided insights into sales performance, order trends, customer demographics, and product effectiveness. Key trends identified include the peak sales year in 2004 and the dominance of “Classic Cars.” Further analyses are recommended to enhance understanding, optimize sales strategies, and boost customer satisfaction, ensuring sustained business success and market competitiveness.
